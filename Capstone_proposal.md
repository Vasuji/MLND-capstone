# Capstone Project Proposal
## Machine Learning Engineer Nano Degree


### Domain Background

Object detection is one of the exciting part of the study in Computer vision and Machine learning. For example human detection in servelence cameras, face and facial expression detection in speech videos etc. This project is greatly inspired by Vehicle detection and Tracking project of the Self Driving Car Nanodegree which is offered at Udacity. The main focus on this project is to build a model for image classification and using it to detect and track the identified image in videos. More specifically it detect and track vehicle in the video.


### Problem Statement

The statement of the problem is ***Vehicle detection and tracking in a video using classifier trained over vehicle and non vehicle image data set*** . The solution to the problem is that, it should be able to select proper pixcels in the image frame in videos as vehicle and draw a rectangular boundary. More technically, the accuracy of the classifier will be calculated with respect to train, test data as well as the performance of classifier on videos. The results thus obtained should be replicable using same data set.

### Data Set and Inputs
 This project will build a classifier using two sets of data called vehicle and nonvehicle. One a model is ready, it will be used to test it's performance on test video. Following are the data sources:
 
 1. Vehicle Images: [Link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/vehicles.zip)
 2. Non-vehicle Images: [Link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/non-vehicles.zip)
